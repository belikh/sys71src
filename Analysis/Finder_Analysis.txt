Finder Binary Analysis Report
=============================

1. File Structure
-----------------
The extracted 'Finder' binary (from System 7.1.2 Disk Tools) was identified as a MacBinary encoded file.
- Data Fork: 0 bytes (Typical for legacy applications).
- Resource Fork: ~377KB.

2. Resource Fork Analysis
-------------------------
The Resource Fork was parsed, revealing the following structure:
- Resource Map Offset: 371388
- Number of Resource Types: (Multiple, including CODE, DLOG, MENUd, etc.)

3. CODE Segments
----------------
The 'CODE' resource type contains the executable machine code.
- CODE 0: Jump Table (Size: 4863 bytes).
- CODE 1: Main Segment (Size: 9187 bytes).
- Total Segments: 176 (CODE IDs range from 0 to ~165).

4. Disassembly & Strings
------------------------
Analysis of CODE 1 (Main Segment) reveals:
- No obvious standard Jump Table (JMP instructions) at the very beginning, suggesting a custom boot/init sequence or segmented loader.
- Strings identified:
  - "ExitVector"
  - "CODE"
  - "Macintosh System version 7.1" (Found in System binary)

5. Entry Point
--------------
The entry point typically resides in CODE 1.
Hex dump of start of CODE 1:
0000000 a8 9f 65 72 00 12 08 01 00 00 2e 64 5c 0a 00 00
0000020 00 00 4b 69 03 20 38 03 22 0c 80 4b 11 20 00 02

6. Decompilation Notes
----------------------
Due to the lack of a specialized 68k disassembler in this environment, full decompilation to C was not possible.
However, the structure confirms this is a standard multi-segment Macintosh application.
The 'MiniFinder.c' stub provided in this repository mimics the behavior of such an application by:
1. Initializing the Toolbox (InitGraf, InitWindows, etc.).
2. Entering a standard Event Loop.
3. Providing a desktop-like background.

This stub allows the system to boot into a graphical state, satisfying the kernel's requirement for a "Finder" process.
